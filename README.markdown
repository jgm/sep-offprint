sep-offprint
============

`sep-offprint` is a perl script that makes offprints from 
[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] articles.

improve it, I would appreciate hearing about it.

Installing sep-offprint
-----------------------

You can download `sep-offprint` [here](http://github.com/jgm/sep-offprint/tarball/master)
or clone the git repository:

    git://github.com/jgm/sep-offprint.git

To use the `sep-offprint` script, you will need Perl and two (free) external
programs:

-   [Ghostscript](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/get851.htm)
-   [html2ps](http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html) (Download the
    tarball or zip file, extract, and run the `install` script.)

If you are running linux or unix (including Mac OS X), you may
already have Ghostscript. You can check by issuing the command:

    which ps2pdf

If it returns a pathname, then you probably have Ghostscript.

You'll also need the Perl modules in LWP (Library for WWW in Perl).
Your perl installation may already contain LWP; if not, you can
install it using cpan:

    cpan -i LWP

(Accept all the defaults.)

On a \*nix system, you will want to put `sep-offprint` in your path
(e.g. in your `~/bin` directory) and make it executable:

    chmod +x sep-offprint

You can then run it from any directory by typing:

    sep-offprint plato

If this doesn't work, you may have to modify the first line of the
script, which tells it where to find perl. Replace `/usr/bin/perl`
in the first line of the script with the path to perl on your
system. To find this path, type:

    which perl

On Windows systems, follow [these instructions], or just type

    perl sep-offprint plato

to run the script.  (Note that if you use the method of associated file-types,
you will have to rename `sep-offprint` as `sep-offprint.pl`, so Windows will
know that it's a perl script.)

Using sep-offprint
------------------

To make a PDF offprint from the "Frege" article, just type:

    sep-offprint frege

If all goes well, the file `frege.pdf` will be created in your
working directory (so make sure you don't already have a file by
that name, or it will be overwritten).  If you have not put
`sep-offprint` in your path as described above, you will have
to put the `sep-offprint` script in your working directory and type

    perl sep-offprint frege

instead of the command above.

To find the official name of an entry, look at the URL. For
example, the URL for my article on
[logical constants](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants)
is `http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants`. The part
after `entries/` is the official name. So, to generate an offprint,
we'd type:

    sep-offprint logical-constants

Or, if you want, use the whole URL:

    sep-offprint http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-constants

If you want to create an offprint from an entry on your local computer
(say, one that you are editing), use a `file://` URL. For example, if
your entry lives in the directory `/home/mmm/entries/truth`, you can use

    sep-offprint file:///home/mmm/entries/truth

to create an offprint from it. (The old `--localpath` option has been
removed, as this is now the preferred way to create offprints from
local entries.)

By default, `sep-offprint` creates PDF offprints with two pages per
side, in landscape mode, using letter size paper and a 14 point
Times font. All of these defaults can be changed using command-line
options. Thus, to create a postscript file instead of a PDF, with
just one page per sheet and A4 paper, type:

    sep-offprint --1up --ps --paper a4 frege

This command will produce a file called `frege.ps` in the working
directory.

To create a PDF with larger print and a sans-serif font, type:

    sep-offprint --size 16pt --font Helvetica frege

Here is a full list of options, with defaults indicated by `*`:

    --1up                  print one page per sheet, portrait orientation
    --2up                  print two pages per sheet, landscape orientation*
    --ps                   produce postscript (PS) output
    --pdf                  produce PDF output*
    --output FILENAME      name of output file (defaults to ENTRYNAME.ps|pdf)
    --font FONT            specify font (Times*, Helvetica, Palatino, Courier)
    --size SIZE            specify font size (10pt, 12pt, 14pt*, 16pt)
    --align ALIGN          specify alignment (left, justified*)
    --paper PAPERSIZE      specify paper size (letter*, legal, a4)
    --linkcolor COLOR      specify color of hyperlinks (black*, gray, blue, ...)
    --help                 this message
    --version              prints version number

Limitations
-----------

Due to limitations in `html2ps`, `sep-offprint` may stumble
on some Unicode characters that render properly in HTML.
The following characters found in some SEP articles 
are not yet properly supported by sep-offprint:

(261) &#261;,
(263) &#263;,
(269) &#269;,
